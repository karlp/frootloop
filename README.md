Testing serial communications between two serial devices.
Call me insane, but I couldn't work out how to script transferring data between
two serial devices on linux.  This is not loopback, this is having two distinct
serial ports with an extern cable connecting them.  Yes, back to the same
machine.

What for?  Well, I was testing a new and rather broken serial port driver for
linux (for the CH34x family of super cheap usb-to-xxx devices) and was sick of
testing it manually with two terminal windows and picoterm and zmodem transfers
and so on.

At least.... that was the plan....
